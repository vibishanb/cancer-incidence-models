# cancer_incidence_models
Two branches:
changes-in-situ: This will involve changes to the code that have been suggested to @vibishanb by Sutirth Dey over the course of RAC meetings.
model-extension: This will involve extension of the model as it stands to address other modes of intra-tumour evolution, and will be pursued by Ketaki over the next few months.

The master branch also has the most recent versions of the cancer incidence model code, with descriptions within.
