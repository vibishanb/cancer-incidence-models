- First proper discussion about model details and corrections
- Start with the human system for how division propensity varies with level of differentiation.
- Readouts-
  - Proportion of stem to non-stem cells
  - Proportion of dividing to non-dividing cells
  - These are plotted against P, Q, mutation rate and fitness gradient
- Assumption: the distribution of mutation effects is not affected by the history of mutation accumulation within a lineage.
- No reproduction => no evolution within the model => no "optimisation" of ontogenetic strategies is happening or looked for.

# 2 April, 2021-model flow discussion with sir
- Deficit should be difference between the target size of differentiated cells and the current number of differentiated cells, or the sum of all cells.
- Division propensities might exceed one, might need normalisation.
- What are the actual values of division probabilities?
- Starting from one cell-concerns?
- Number of replicates for a given target size?
- Possible avenue of further work-one cell vs a fraction of cell becoming cancerous
  - Whatever processes go into cancer are to do with mutation accumulation. Those processes are contained within a single cell sufficiently to address the effects of mutation accumulation. The fraction of cells is a process of progression that, while relevant ecologically and physiologically, do not affect mutation accumulation dynamics in so far as development is concerned. For these processes further down the line to relevant developmentally to cancer incidence, they need to relate back to organism fitness which requires sexual reproduction that is distributed in time and would therefore be affected more continuously by not only mutation accumulation but also progressive growth of cancer clones.
