    "# Branching model of cancer incidence\n",
    "\n",
    "This code simulates a branching process of somatic evolution, with stochastic mutation accumulation and cell\n",
    "populations undergo logistic growth. Competition between populations is captured through a shared carrying capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "V1 [started on 5 March]:\n",
    "- Intrinsic growth rate given by random samples from a normally-distributed 'g'. Carrying capacity calculated as sum(all other existing populations)-carrying capacity of the focal population.\n",
    "- Since growth/transition rates are samples from the same distribution, this is the context-independent version of the model.\n",
    "- Working draft finalised on 17 April.\n",
    "\n",
    "V2 [started on 15 May]:\n",
    "- Different form of branching model, with a common carrying capacity that is constant across cell populations, along with density-dependent interaction coefficients, `alpha`, that carry the effect of inter-clone competition.\n",
    "- Individual values of carrying capacity do not change between populations.\n",
    "- `alpha` values are assigned pairwise, to each combination of cell populations, within the function, `generate_mutant_pop()`. Each population gets an array of `alpha` values corresponding to each pairwise interaction.\n",
    "    - New values are generated with every new population, both for the new population, and for the new interaction that is added to the old populations. Therefore, if there are `n` populations including the new mutant, all `alpha` arrays would be `n-1` elements long, with each array updated with the corresponding number of values.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: `alpha` values of reciprocal interactions are independent, that is, `alpha(i,j)` and `alpha(j,i)` are assigned independently of each other.\n",
    "- `k_calculate()` from V1 is dropped in V2, and `generate_mutant_pop()` must include updating the `alpha` matrix with corresponding interaction coefficients.\n",
    "- `grow_logistically()` calculates size as the sum of intrinsic logistic growth of current population and effect of competitive or facilitative interactions of other populations.\n",
    "- `drop_dead()` from V1 has been changed to `make_dead()` to make the handling of negative population sizes. `make_dead()` simply sets the growth rate and population size to `0` for those cell populations whose size has declined below `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assumption stated above needs to be examined carefully.\n",
    "- Are there any *a priori* reasons for the shape of the `alpha` distribution to affect cancer incidence?\n",
    "- `alpha_matrix` will be an interesting parameter to study; at the end of the simulation, it provides a snapshot of the ecological interaction landscape of tumours in the entire population. Technically, with the shared carrying capacity model, we have shown that cancer progression in the model does not *require* mutualistic interactions between clones. There might however be questions worth pursuing about the interactions of a wider range of ecological behaviours and other basic parameters like the mutation rate.\n",
    "- Ultimately, this might just end up being another, equivalent way of presenting a more selection-centric rather than a mutation-centric picture."
