A set of numerical simulations to address mechanisms of cancer progression
Detailed description can be found in the PDF file in the _master_ branch.

The _branching-model_ branch contains current work on building a simulation of somatic cell evolution through a branching process; this involves parallel and competitive growth of several cell populations at different mutational stages.
As always, five mutations lead to cancer.
