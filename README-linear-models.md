# Linear evolution models
A set of numerical simulations to address mechanisms of cancer progression
Detailed description can be found in the PDF file in the _master_ branch.

The linear evolution regime was the first one to be considered in the incidence models, with each mutant population growing with complete replacement of the extant population of cells. As opposed to the branching mode in which multiple clonal populations could be growing in parallel with a wide range of interactions between them, linear evolution gives rise to completely clonal progression with virtually zero intra-tumour heterogeneity.

In this set of models, three forms of the linear evoluton mode have been considered: homogenous population, hetergenous population and age effects on the selective advantage of mutations. Corresponding code versions are v6, v7 and v8 respectively.
