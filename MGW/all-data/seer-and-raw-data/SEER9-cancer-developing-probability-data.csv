"Data Source:"
"Underlying Incidence data are from the SEER 18 areas [http://seer.cancer.gov/registries/terms.html] (San Francisco, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Utah, Atlanta, San Jose-Monterey, Los Angeles, Alaska Native Registry, Rural Georgia, California excluding SF/SJM/LA, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey and Georgia excluding ATL/RG)."
"Underlying Mortality data are from the NCHS public use data file for the total US."
Methodology:
"Risk estimates are calculated using the <a href = http://surveillance.cancer.gov/devcan/"">DevCan</a> application."
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"Rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives only include cases that are in a Contract Health Service Delivery Area (CHSDA). See  SEER Race Recode Documentation for American Indian/Alaskan Native Statistics [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#ai-an]."
"Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are not mutually exclusive from whites, blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. "
"Incidence data for Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are based on the NAACCR Hispanic Latino Identification Algorithm (NHIA) and exclude cases from the Alaska Native Registry. See SEER Race Recode Documentation for Spanish-Hispanic-Latino Ethnicity [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#hispanic]."
"See the Policy for Calculating Hispanic Mortality [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/mort/origin_recode_1990+/index.html] for information about underlying Hiapnic mortality rates."
"Cancer Site Coding:"
"Cancer sites are defined using the SEER Site Recode ICD-O-3/WHO 2008 Definition [https://seer.cancer.gov/siterecode/icdo3_dwhoheme/index.html] and the <a href=""https://seer.cancer.gov/codrecode/1969+_d04162012/index.html"" >SEER Cause of Death Recode 1969+ (04/16/2012)</a>."
